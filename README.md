# Inventory management

An inventory management system.

Right now is a text-based system written in Python, using SQLite3 as database.

It has six options: 
- add a product with quantity and department 
- update the quantity of a product
- remove the product
- display the whole inventory or a specific departement
- search for a product by text
- export the database to a csv file.

Next step is to add a graphical interface.
